2023-05-21 13:29:01,618 Correlation requires Python version 3.10 or greater.
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619 Your version is 3.11
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619 Here's some time series data:
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619 xtimes:[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619 yvalues:[3, 6, 9, 21, 24, 26, 28, 29, 32, 34, 36, 38]
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619 correlation between xtimes and xtimes = 1.00
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619 correlation between xtimes and yvalues = 0.96
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619 Here's some bivariant data (2 variables, together):
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619 x:[-250, -150, -100, 40, 0, 40, 100, 150]
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619 y:[-220, -164, -99, 36, 19, 75, 130, 135]
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619 Calculate the slope and intercept of a best fit straight line:
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619    slope = 0.99
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619    intercept = 9.95
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619 Let's use our best fit line to PREDICT a future value.
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619    At future x = 200,
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619    we predict the value of y will be 207.
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619 How'd we do? Does this make sense given the data?
2023-05-21 13:29:01,619 Remember to close the app. Control c (or d or z maybe) to close it.
